**** Instructions **** 

To begin with, choose the number of questions you would like
to be asked. This quiz does not have the option to either have
0 rounds (which will automatically end the game) or neither has
infinity, so an exit code is not allowed too.

The quiz is filled with randomized linear math equations. No questions
in this quiz are equal to a negative number or a decimal place, so
make sure you answer with a positive integer.

Your goal is to answer all the questions and aim for the
highest score by answering all the questions correctly. 
Statistics at the end will display the numbers of questions
that are answered correct, wrong. It will also provide an
average score between the two (correct/wrong).

Your game history will be displayed at the end (on command) showing how many
questions you've gotten right or answered incorrectly. Reminder
that this (the game history) is optional to see.

Best of luck, Yours Truly Kaea.
